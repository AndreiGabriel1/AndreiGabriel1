# Andrei-Gabriel Dinu

TypeScript-first developer focused on React, Node.js and clean, scalable architecture.  
I practice a high-signal workflow: clarity, predictable code, and senior-layer reasoning.

### Core Projects
- **EventFlow** — modern event management system (TypeScript, modular routing, URL-sync logic)
- **BuildTracker** — materials & inventory tracking (CRUD core, validation, slug system)
- **AFrameHub** — gallery & detail views with extendable review system
- **Showcase** — curated index of pre-interview projects

### Focus
- TypeScript mastery  
- React architecture & composition patterns  
- Node.js APIs, routing and validation  
- High-level reasoning, debugging workflow, performance-first thinking

### Contact
LinkedIn available on request.

# Hi, I'm Andrei-Gabriel Dinu

I build TypeScript-first systems with clear boundaries, deterministic behavior, and explicit handling of failure cases.

## Highlighted work

### AngleLab Explore
A compact end-to-end system designed for inspection and discussion:
- Layered core with explicit ownership of responsibilities
- Deterministic rules pipeline (no forced answers)
- CLI + Next.js consumer reusing the same core

### EventFlow
A compact TypeScript + Express API with a stable contract and a minimal probe UI:
- Stable response envelope (`{ ok, data }`)
- Deterministic search + explicit fallback behavior
- Static UI to validate the API end-to-end (no framework required)

## What I optimize for
- Small, inspectable modules
- Stable contracts at boundaries
- Deterministic flows over “magic”
- Failure paths as first-class citizens
