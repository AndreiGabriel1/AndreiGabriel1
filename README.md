# Andrei-Gabriel Dinu

TypeScript-first developer building small, inspectable systems: stable contracts, deterministic behavior, and explicit failure handling.

## Selected work

### AngleLab Explore
A compact end-to-end system built for clear inspection and discussion:
- layered core with explicit ownership boundaries
- deterministic rules pipeline (refine → rank → select) with “no decision” outcomes
- CLI + Next.js consumer reusing the same core

### EventFlow
A compact TypeScript + Express API demonstrating contract-first backend fundamentals:
- stable response envelope (`{ ok, data }`) and clear HTTP failure behavior
- deterministic search with explicit fallback (`isFallbackQuery`)
- minimal probe UI (`/index.html`, `/details.html`) to validate the flow end-to-end
