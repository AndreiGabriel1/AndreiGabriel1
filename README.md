# Hi, I'm Andrei-Gabriel Dinu

I build TypeScript-first systems with clear boundaries, deterministic behavior, and explicit handling of failure cases.

## Highlighted work

### AngleLab Explore
A compact end-to-end system designed for inspection and discussion:
- Layered core with explicit ownership of responsibilities
- Deterministic rules pipeline (no forced answers)
- CLI + Next.js consumer reusing the same core

### EventFlow
A compact TypeScript + Express API with a stable contract and a minimal probe UI:
- Stable response envelope (\{ ok, data }`)`
- Deterministic search + explicit fallback behavior
- Static UI to validate the API end-to-end (no framework required)

## What I optimize for
- Small, inspectable modules
- Stable contracts at boundaries
- Deterministic flows over "magic"
- Failure paths as first-class citizens
