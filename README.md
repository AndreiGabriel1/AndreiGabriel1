TypeScript-first developer focused on React, Node.js and clean, scalable architecture.  
I practice a high-signal workflow: clarity, predictable code, and senior-layer reasoning.

- **BuildTracker** — materials & inventory tracking (CRUD core, validation, slug system)
- **AFrameHub** — gallery & detail views with extendable review system
- **Showcase** — curated index of pre-interview projects

### Focus
- TypeScript mastery  
- React architecture & composition patterns  
- Node.js APIs, routing and validation  
- High-level reasoning, debugging workflow, performance-first thinking
